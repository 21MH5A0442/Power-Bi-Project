Here’s a README file for a Power BI project analyzing Adidas sales in the U.S., which you can use for GitHub:


Overview

This Power BI project provides a comprehensive analysis of Adidas sales data in the U.S. by integrating various datasets, including sales transactions, product information, customer demographics, store/channel data, and promotion details. This project is designed to help stakeholders visualize sales performance, customer trends, and the effectiveness of different channels and promotions. 

Project Objectives

Sales Performance Analysis: Track sales trends over time, identify top-performing products, and analyze sales by region and channel.
Customer Insights: Understand the demographics of Adidas customers, including age, gender, and geographic distribution.
Promotion Effectiveness: Evaluate the impact of different promotional strategies on sales.
Product Analysis: Analyze product performance across categories and understand product preferences by demographics.

Project Structure

Data Sources

This project uses several key datasets in CSV format. Each dataset is loaded into Power BI as a separate data table:

1. Sales Transactions: Records of individual sales transactions.
   Fields: `TransactionID`, `Date`, `ProductID`, `StoreID`, `Quantity`, `Revenue`, `DiscountApplied`

2. Product_Catalog: Information about each Adidas product.
   Fields: `ProductID`, `Category`, `Subcategory`, `ProductName`, `Price`, `Color`, `Size`

3. Customer_Demographics: Demographic data for Adidas customers.
   Fields: `CustomerID`, `Age`, `Gender`, `Location`, `LoyaltyProgram`

4. Store_Channel_Data: Details of sales channels, both physical and online.
   Fields: `StoreID`, `Location`, `ChannelType`, `StoreSize`

5. Promotions_Discounts: Promotion details to analyze their impact.
   Fields: `PromotionID`, `PromotionType`, `StartDate`, `EndDate`, `DiscountRate`, `TargetProducts`

Power BI Reports

The project includes the following Power BI reports:

Sales Dashboard: Tracks overall sales performance with metrics like total revenue, units sold, average sale per customer, and sales by region.
- Customer Insights Dashboard: Visualizes demographic data, showing key insights into customer age, gender, and location.
- Product Analysis Dashboard: Allows analysis of product performance by category, price range, and other product attributes.
- Promotion Effectiveness Dashboard: Measures the impact of various promotions and discounts on sales, comparing periods with and without promotions.

Getting Started

1. Data Import: Import each CSV file listed above into Power BI Desktop.
2. Data Transformation: Use Power Query to clean and prepare data (e.g., handling missing values, formatting dates, creating calculated columns).
3. Relationships: Define relationships between tables in the Power BI model (e.g., linking `ProductID` in `Sales_Transactions` to `Product Catalog`).
4. Dashboard Creation: Build visuals and reports using Power BI’s visualization tools to address each objective.
5. Publish and Share: Publish the reports to the Power BI Service to share with stakeholders.
