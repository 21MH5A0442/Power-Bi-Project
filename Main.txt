To analyse Adidas sales in the U.S., several main files or datasets can be essential, including:

1. Sales Transactions File: This includes records of individual sales transactions across various locations or online channels, detailing date, product ID, quantity sold, and revenue.

2. Product Catalog File: A list of products, including SKU or product ID, category, subcategory, product description, price, and relevant attributes like colour and size.

3. Customer Demographics File: Information about customer segments, such as age, gender, location, and possibly loyalty program membership.

4. Store or Channel Data File: Details on each retail or online channel, including geographic location, channel type (e.g., retail store, online), and any special features (e.g., flagship stores, outlet stores).

5. Promotions and Discounts File: A record of promotions or discounts applied to Adidas products, detailing promotion type, duration, discount rate, and target products or categories.

6. Market and Competitor Data File: If available, this would contain information on market trends, competitor sales, and any external factors impacting sales, like economic conditions or seasonality.

These files can then be combined and analysed to get insights into sales performance, customer behaviour, and market trends across Adidasâ€™ U.S. market.
